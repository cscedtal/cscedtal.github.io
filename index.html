  <h2>Problemstatement: College for Dummies</h2>
  <p>
   New students arrive at university with no way of knowing how to get to class the fastest way, where to park, or what dining halls they should use. This causes students a lot of stress since maps takes you on the main route, which might be 10 minutes longer thana short cut or you don't know where other dining halls are, so they are stuck eating at the same one every day.

   My group and I worked together to brainstorm ideas for our app which helps students find the most efficient way access all of their essential needs. Maps will take you the most common way to your destination, but what if you are on a time crunch? So we came up with a bunch of ways that we could possibly use to help students better use the dining halls, gyms, and transportations. We found out that there could be a lot of different uses to our app, even on the social side of campus.
