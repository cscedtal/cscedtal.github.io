All you need is a ball. But it is even more fun with some friends.

<h2> Reason 2: Soccer is the best sport because anyone can play!</h2>
<p>
The second reason is because it can be played by anyone.
It does not matter where you are from, what you look like, anyone will let you join their game.
It is the most loving and respecting sport in my opinion.
It is said to be a happy plave for many.
